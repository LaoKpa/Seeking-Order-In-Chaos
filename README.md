The human mind is fascinating. Give it a series of observations, and it will attempt to find structure to it. It will find variables upon which the given data might depend on, and develop elaborate models, in the hopes of predicting future observations. What if this search for the Holy Grail is all in vain? What if we have been fooled by randomness? 

Information is growing sparser in the wake of the information age. It is becoming increasingly hard to find relevant content, or to know where to start. This book is my attempt at explaining the principles governing the financial markets in a logical, progressive and intuitive manner. It is an introduction to statistics, Python's relevant libraries, and a synthesis of relevant Investopedia pages, Wikipedia articles, popular investment books and basic financial literature. We will also use Python to implement the ideas and strategies outlined and see how they hold up with the actual market.
